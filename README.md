### CS-321 Project Four: BTree
#### Rachel Singleton, Zachary Sherwood, Jacob Uzabel, Michael Smith
#### Professor: Dr. Yeh

#### Layout of BTree:
Our implementation for this project includes the following files
* GeneBankCreateBTree.java --> main program
* BTree.java
* BTreeNode.java
* TreeObject.java
* DataManagement.java
* Cache.java
* GeneBankSearch.java --> main program

GeneBankCreateBTree.java creates the BTree from a .gbk file.  
The binary data file that nodes are written to and read from is created by the BTree constructor.  
GeneBankSearch.java searches a specified binary data file for a specific sequence.  

To run either of the driver classes, use the following arguments:
* `java GeneBankCreateBTree <0/1(no/with Cache)> <degree> <gbk file> <sequence length> [<cache size>] [<debug level>]`
* `java GeneBankSearch <0/1(no/with Cache)> <btree file> <query file> [<cache size>] [<debug level>]`
  
Cache size and debug level are optional arguments for both driver classes. 

#### Layout of the BTree on the disk:
We chose to design our BTree like the following:


#### Issues we ran into:
This project came at a difficult time for everyone in our group. Not only did we have one group member (Rachel Singleton) who was forced
to move back to Seattle, Washington late-semester. We also had one member (Michael Smith) who contracted some illness and was not able to contribute anything to the project.
We were not able to successfully implement: any cache functionality, dump file creation of a specified sequence and frequency, and any search
capability from geneBankSearch. Many problems arose from miscommunications, work (and loss of) and a general inability to access resources that would have
been available to us if we had not been forced to access our classes remotely (tutoring centers, in-person LA meetings, etc.).

We were able to complete a modicum of functionality from geneBankCreateBTree that successfully created a binary file with the correct amount of sequences converted
correctly. 

#### Cache Size Observations:

#### Math to figure out the optimal degree for our BTree:
* metadata for 1 BTreeNode = 17 bytes
* 1 parent pointer = 4 bytes
* array of child pointers = (2t)(4) = 8t bytes
* array of TreeObjects = (2t-1)(12) = 24t-12 bytes

17 + 4 + 8t + 24t - 12 <= 4096  
32t + 9 <= 4096  
t <= 127.71  
Therefore, our optimal degree is t = 127
